# HAVEN Work Experience Placement Exercise
# This is an exercise to familiarise yourself with the work that we are doing with 
# HAVEN (at least the brain-based stuff) and to provide guidance for your data analysis

# What is the HAVEN project? 
# Have a read through the Participant Information Guide, although just focus on the 
# brain/psychology part (you don't need to worry about platelets!)

# Your presentation should start by giving a brief overview of the HAVEN project

# Questions to think about for using R to work with HAVEN data

# 1) What questions would you be interested in understanding? Why? 

# 2) How would you answer these questions? What methods/tests would you use?

# 3) What parts of the brain are we interested in? What are they involved with?
# Read about the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus and their invovlement 
# with episodic memory function

# 4) What relationships between brain and body data would we want to understand?

# 5) What other untested relationships could we look at in the future?
